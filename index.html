        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        <!-- for italic use em -->
        <em>fundamental</em>
        technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
        web.

        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
        <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
        language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
        of a webpage (not a programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>
          The actual element You can learn more at the

        </li>
      </ol>

<!-- STRONG and EM are the reason why things are done...to make them strongly appear and emphasize the italic text--Welcome to HTML5 -->

<!-- all text should be in some form of an element -->

<!--HTML5 brought SEMANTIC HTML is to consider what an element means instead of how it looks on page. STRONG instead of b and EM instead of the small i. Also notice how you used nav instead of div -the nav box implies a meaning not just a generic div.-->

<!-- Semantic HTML helps with SEO Search Engine Optimization-->
